# Weather Visual Engine

A local runnable H5 weather visual engine powered by OpenWeatherMap. It combines geolocation, saved city management, unit switching, festival overlays, and a prompt-builder module for rendering weather as a visual card experience.

## Features

- Geolocation auto detection with city resolution through OpenWeatherMap weather data
- City manager with saved cities in browser `localStorage`
- Metric and imperial unit switch
- Festival and seasonal overlay system
- Prompt builder module that returns display copy and a visual-generation prompt
- OpenAI image generation for automatic isometric weather scenes
- Local image cache served from `public/generated/`
- OpenWeatherMap integration through a Node Express backend
- Static H5 frontend served by Express
- Responsive card UI for desktop and mobile

## Setup

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

2. Create `.env` from the example:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

3. Add your OpenWeatherMap key:

```text
OPENWEATHER_API_KEY=your_openweathermap_api_key
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
OPENAI_IMAGE_MODEL=gpt-image-1
OPENAI_IMAGE_SIZE=1536x1024
OPENAI_IMAGE_QUALITY=high
SCENE_OUTPUT_SIZE=3840x2160
PORT=3000
```

4. Start the server:

```bash
npm start
```

5. Open the app:

```text
http://localhost:3000
```

## API

### `GET /api/weather`

Query by city:

```text
/api/weather?city=Detroit&units=metric
```

Query by coordinates:

```text
/api/weather?lat=42.3314&lon=-83.0458&units=imperial
```

Response includes:

- `weather`: normalized OpenWeatherMap data and visual metadata
- `festival`: active festival or seasonal overlay
- `prompt`: structured display copy and visual prompt
- `scene`: generated isometric scene metadata with a cached local image path when available

## Image Generation

When `/api/weather` succeeds, the backend builds an isometric scene prompt from the normalized weather, festival overlay, and visual prompt. It then:

1. Hashes the prompt to create a stable cache key.
2. Checks `public/generated/` for a cached PNG.
3. Generates a new high-quality source image through OpenAI only on cache miss.
4. Resizes the source image locally to the configured scene output size.
5. Returns the local image path for the homepage to render.

Generated images are local runtime artifacts and are ignored by git.

OpenAI image generation does not currently produce native `3840x2160` output from the Image API. The app defaults to a high-quality `1536x1024` source image and writes a local `3840x2160` PNG cache using Lanczos resizing through `sharp`.

## Tests

Run the local test suite:

```bash
npm test
```

The tests cover festival overlays, structured prompt generation, image-generation configuration, and local 4K image output dimensions.

## Environment

See `.env.example`:

```text
OPENWEATHER_API_KEY=your_openweathermap_api_key
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
OPENAI_IMAGE_MODEL=gpt-image-1
OPENAI_IMAGE_SIZE=1536x1024
OPENAI_IMAGE_QUALITY=high
SCENE_OUTPUT_SIZE=3840x2160
PORT=3000
```
